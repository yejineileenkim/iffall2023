            Welcome to the Y2K Aesthetic
        </div>
        <div class="introRightText">
            The Y2K aesthetic, born from the turn of the millennium's tech optimism and transition vibes, has resurged
            as a
            leading trend in today's fashion and design landscapes. Drawing from its audacious metallic and glittering
            motifs, artists and designers are reviving and reinterpreting this era, capturing both nostalgia and modern
            appeal.

                Y2K (also known as Kaybug or Cybercore) is an aesthetic that was prevalent in popular culture from
                roughly 1997 to 2004, succeeding the Memphis Design and Grunge eras and overlapping with the McBling,
                UrBling, Surf Crush, and 2K1 aesthetics. Named after the Year 2000 problem, it is characterized by a
                distinct aesthetic period, encapsulating fashion, hardware design, music, and furnishings shining with
                tech optimismâ€”sometimes literally. Some of its aspects include tight leather pants, shiny clothing,
                silver eye shadow, spiky up-dos, Oakleys, gradients, translucence, and Blobitecture. Most Y2K aesthetics
                rely on the use of technology and slick futuristic looks, signaling the optimism for the 3rd Millennium
                or 21st Century. The Y2K Era ended around 2004 and was succeeded by the Frutiger Aero era.

            year 2000 problem
        </div>
        <div>The year 2000 problem, also commonly known as the Y2K problem, Y2K scare, millennium bug, Y2K bug, Y2K
            glitch, Y2K error, or simply Y2K refers to potential computer errors related to the formatting and storage
            of calendar data for dates in and after the year 2000. Many programs represented four-digit years with only
            the final two digits, making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900. Computer systems' inability to
            distinguish dates correctly had the potential to bring down worldwide infrastructures for computer reliant
            industries. In the years leading up to the turn of the century (millennium), the public gradually became
            aware of the "Y2K scare", and individual companies predicted the global damage caused by the bug would
            require anything between $400 million and $600 billion to rectify. A lack of clarity regarding the potential
            dangers of the bug led some to stock up on food, water, and firearms, purchase backup generators, and
            withdraw large sums of money in anticipation of a computer-induced apocalypse. </div>
        <div> Contrary to published expectations, few major errors occurred in 2000. Supporters of the Y2K remediation
            effort argued that this was primarily due to the pre-emptive action of many computer programmers and
            information technology experts. Companies and organizations in some countries, but not all, had checked,
            fixed, and upgraded their computer systems to address the problem. Then-U.S. president Bill Clinton, who
            organized efforts to minimize the damage in the United States, labeled Y2K as "the first challenge of the
            21st century successfully met", and retrospectives on the event typically commend the programmers who worked
            to avert the anticipated disaster.
        </div>
        <div>
            Critics argued that even in countries where very little had been done to fix software, problems were
            minimal. The same was true in sectors such as schools and small businesses where compliance with Y2K
            policies was patchy at best.

            Y2K is a very new concept, but with certain brands that were popular at the time still existing, one could
            easily predict these brands could potentially play a huge role in Y2K. Basically, you'd either look like a
            Late '90s/Early 2000s raver or a member of a boy band from the time. There were also alternative streetwear
            styles in this era, such as frosted tips, baggy JNCO jeans, and puka shell necklaces (commonly associated
            with musical genres/subcultures such as Nu-Metal, third-wave ska, and pop punk). Also, it should be noted a
            lot of Holosexual aesthetics and style can turn up in Y2K fashion as well (due to its usage in futuristic
            fashion at the time). Low-rise skirts are usually really popular in this aesthetic. Japan's Fruits magazine,
            published from 1997 to 2017, has also been popular among Y2K fashion revivalists.

        </div>
        <div> Since Y2K was about embracing the future, the tone of music also reflected this. Electronic music was the
            go-to genre to capture this era as a musician. Record labels associated with Y2K include System Records and
            Eldia.

            Nu-metal and Industrial rock were closely associated with the Y2K period, particularly in the United States
            and France, and received particular attention after the Woodstock '99 festival. The subgenres epitomized the
            more masculine aesthetics of the Y2K period, combining Hip-Hop and Electronic styles with Heavy Metal. Bands
            such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Deftones, Filter, Incubus, Coal Chamber, American Head Charge, and
            Marilyn Manson epitomized this controversial strain of Y2K culture. Acts like Nine Inch Nails, Tool, and
            White Zombie served as progenitors of Y2K musical aesthetics in the early and middle portions of the 1990s
            decade. Subcultural styles like Mallgoth, Rivethead, and Cybergoth epitomized part of the Dark Y2K style, a
            subtle offshoot of the Y2K aesthetic heavily inspired by nu-metal and industrial culture in the Y2K era.

        <div> 2004 </div>
        <div> 2004 was the last hurrah of Y2K, being the last year where the aesthetic(s) experienced any form of
            mainstream popularity. Cartoon Network switched from the "Powerhouse" era to "CN City" era, with most of
            their '90s programs ending and Toonami moving to Saturday nights. Nickelodeon went through a similar
            transition also, with '90s Nicktoons, the SNICK block, and pre-movie SpongeBob SquarePants ending. The final
            major Nu-Metal albums were released in 2004, and emo soon overtook nu-metal as the dominant "alternative"
            music genre; the popularization of MySpace and release of Green Day's American Idiot. McDonald's retired the
            McDonaldLand characters (except for Ronald McDonald) and rebranded from the "We love to see you smile"
            slogan to the infamous "I'm lovin' it" slogan. The first Web 2.0 conference was held in October 2004, early
            social media sites such as MySpace were rising in popularity. Marvel's Blade series, known for its heavy use
            of Y2K aesthetics and music, ended. The Rock retired from WWE, and Brock Lesnar temporarily left to join the
            NFL, leaving John Cena to become the face of the company.</div>

        <div> Post-Y2K (2005 onwards)</div>
        <div> By 2005, the Y2K aesthetic had more or less vanished completely. After Y2K ended, it gave way to the
            Frutiger Aero aesthetic, which coincided with the advent of Web 2.0; Frutiger Aero is widely considered
            Y2K's successor aesthetic, containing various similarities but being distinct as an aesthetic in its own
            right.</div>

        <div> Contemporary Use/"Neo-Y2K" (Mid 2010s-present)</div>
        <div> Since the Mid-Late 2010s, Y2K Era imagery and pop culture has begun to make a resurgence in various
            circles of the Internet, niche entertainment, and even mainstream entertainment due to the 20-year nostalgia
            cycle. Examples of Y2K revival songs include "1999" by Charli XCX, "2002" by Anne Marie, and "Motivation" by
            Normani. Evan Collins coined the term in 2016, having noticed the aesthetic had not yet been explored by the
            Vaporwave scene as much as earlier, more ubiquitous periods[2] (i.e. '80s/Early '90s aesthetics like Memphis
            and Synthwave), and wanting to give it more exposure. Collins runs the Y2K Aesthetic Institute along with
            Froyo Tam. They archive works exhibiting the aesthetic, in the fields of graphic design, flyers, game
            console design, video game concept art, interior design, architecture, fashion, etc. and chronicle both art
            from the era the aesthetic was popular, as well as modern depictions of the aesthetic. Tam has also made
            Ferrite Core DX and other open-source typefaces inspired by Y2K typography.Another example of modern-Y2K
            aesthetics being used is the indie puzzle game known as CROSSNIQ+, which utilizes the more bold, thick-line
            aesthetics seen in Y2K cartoon styles. Also run by Krieger and The Y2K Institute is u::r::here, a free
            virtual gallery dedicated to showing off Y2K art and aesthetics.The most major community forum that is based
            on Y2K aesthetics is Agora Road's Macintosh Cafe, which coins itself as a "nostalgic Y2K community". There
            are some smaller ones, such as the Orion's Arm forum, although that one is primarily about the fictional
            universe itself.*The aesthetic seems to be breaking into pop culture, such as the Charli XCX and Troye Sivan
            song 1999.</div>
